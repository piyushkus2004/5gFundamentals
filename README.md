# 5G Fundamentals

## Wireless Communication
 - Allows the transfer of information over the air between the transmitter and reciever
 - Same device acts as both transmitter a transmitter and reciever

## Radio Frequency (RF)
 - RF is a electromagnetic signal which is characterizd by its wavelength and frequency
 - frequency{3khz - 300ghz}
 - wavelength{100km-1mm}

## Radio signaal properties
- travel at the speed of light ~ 300,000km/sec

## Carriers Waves and Modulation
- RF signals used for information transfer also known as carrier waves
- Moulation is which i used to impress information onto carrier wave for transmission
## Analog and Digital Modulation
- digital modulation is used for discrete or binary information represented by bits(0s and 1s)
- analog modulation is used to transfer low b frequency based signal

## Noise and interference
- when information is sent over any wireless communication link noise and interference is introduced
- noise - unwanted energy
- interfrence - it is a form of energy
