# 5G Fundamentals

## Wireless Communication
 - Allows the transfer of information over the air between the transmitter and reciever
 - Same device acts as both transmitter a transmitter and reciever

## Radio Frequency (RF)
 - RF is a electromagnetic signal which is characterizd by its wavelength and frequency
 - frequency{3khz - 300ghz}
 - wavelength{100km-1mm}

## Radio signaal properties
- travel at the speed of light ~ 300,000km/sec

## Carriers Waves and Modulation
- RF signals used for information transfer also known as carrier waves
- Moulation is which i used to impress information onto carrier wave for transmission
## Analog and Digital Modulation
- digital modulation is used for discrete or binary information represented by bits(0s and 1s)
- analog modulation is used to transfer low b frequency based signal

## Noise and interference
- when information is sent over any wireless communication link noise and interference is introduced
- noise - unwanted energy
- interfrence - it is a form of energy

## Radio Spectrum
- it simply the range of radio frequencies over which wireless communication takes places dor a specific purpose
- RS of mobile phones - {450MHz to 3800MHz}
- every country has government agencies responsible for its spectrum planning

## Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)
- mobile system uses fdd
- pair of radio channel for two way communication
- both side can transmit information at the same time on independent links

  ## Time division duplexity
  - not all radio spectrum is allowed with frequency duplexed links
  - TDD uses a single radio channel for two-way communication by allocating different transmission times for each direction (uplink/downlink)

    ## Radio channel-bandwidth
    - a radio signal that carries information uses a range of frequencies over which communication link is established.
    - radio channel = data pipe
    - wider = more data , narrow = less data
